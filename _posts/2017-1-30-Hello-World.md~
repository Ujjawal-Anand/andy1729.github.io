I had previously tried to create my own blog enabled website but becuase of the amount of work it requires to create such site (we are talking about a well maintained backend with database and all), I couldn't bring this idea in action.

Few months went by and one day I was just reading about a blog and in the footer of of the same, I saw "Powered by Jekyll".So out of curiosity I google "Jekyll" and went through first few links, all of them saying, more or less the same thing that "Jekyll is really cool and with help of it you can create your own blog in very few steps".

Fast forward yesteday (29 Jan 2017) I thought to give it a try and started with the documentation and all. And after 8 straight hours, here I am writing my first blog.

Thanks to Tom Preston-Werner (creator of Jekyll) and the entire team behind "Jekyll" for this amazing piece of software.
