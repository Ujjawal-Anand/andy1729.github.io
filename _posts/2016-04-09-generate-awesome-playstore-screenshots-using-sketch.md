**Because First Impression Matters**, Seting up right screenshots is a crucial element for the success of your App. Your screenshots should attract and convince the user at first sign.

*Many studies demonstrated how great screens help to increase downloads up to 50%.*

#### Why this tool

> Because it's a redundant task for Developers/Marketers and someone should build this generator and guess what God choosed me for that (waaaay up, I feel blessed) :innocent:  
> There are many similar generators for iOS apps; which are not really suitable for the our case, since Android has its own specifications like phone model, status bar ...
