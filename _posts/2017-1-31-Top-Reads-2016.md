title: My Favourite Read From The Past - Startups, Tech. Life

> Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.<br/>
> -Joseph Addision

One of the habits I grew in myself which I am really proud of and really goes into making the person I am today is: **Learning a lot of things by Reading a lot of things.** <br/>
In course of time, I've consumed many articles (mostly on Internet) and have bookmarked the one I like the most. The following is a list of some of my favourite articles from the past year in no particular order.

I’d encourage you to scroll through the entire list and read the ones that seem interesting to you. And feel free to share what you loved to read this year
