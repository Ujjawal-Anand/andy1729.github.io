<p>One of the habits I grew in myself which I am really proud of and really goes into making the person I am today is: <strong>Learning a lot of things by Reading a lot of things.</strong> <br />
In course of time, I’ve consumed many articles (mostly on Internet) and have bookmarked the one I like the most. The following is a list of some of my favourite articles from the past year in no particular order.</p>

<p>I’d encourage you to scroll through the entire list and read the ones that seem interesting to you. And feel free to share what you loved to read this year</p>
